# BHP-Prediction-Model
This ML model can predict the housing prices based on certain parameters.  I have used a Kaggle Dataset to train it using SciKit-Learn. For frontend I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript as for backend I have used Flask and NGINX. 
I used Pandas for data cleansing and making sure that there are no outliers, then performed some feature engineering to understand the data.
After cleaning and understanding the data I used Linear Regression for training my model. I chose Linear Regression after performing GridSearchCv and Cross Validation to check which of the classification technique performed the best. 
Then I transferred the model to a pickel file so it can be used by anyone.
Later I created a website using HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend and Flask and NGINX for the backend.
This Project performs perfectly well and helped me understand a lot of complex concepts like Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Backend Development etc.
Hope this can help you do the same!
